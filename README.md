# 🏀 BasketMania

**BasketMania** is a collaborative Android application developed as part of a class project. The app was created using **Android Studio** and **Java**, and it includes a supporting web application and database system.

## 📱 About the Project

BasketMania is a basketball-themed mobile application designed to deliver a dynamic user experience for basketball fans. The app was built by a team of students and incorporates both client-side and server-side functionality.

### 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Java** – For Android app development
- **Android Studio** – Primary development environment
- **PHP, HTML, CSS** – For the web backend and interface
- **MySQL** – For managing the app's databases

## 🌐 Web Application

Alongside the Android app, a web-based backend was developed using:

- **PHP** – For server-side scripting
- **HTML/CSS** – For structuring and styling the web pages

The web app handles data operations, API communication, and possibly administrative features. It plays a crucial role in synchronizing app data with the backend database.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `/app` – Android Studio Java source code
- `/web` – PHP/HTML/CSS code for the web backend
- `/db` – SQL files or scripts for database creation
- `/manual` – User or technical manual
- `.gitignore` – Git configuration for ignoring build and config files
- `README.md` – This file

## 🧠 Team Effort

This was a **team-based class project**. Each team member had specific responsibilities. Although I don't recall my exact role on the Android side, I was responsible for **creating the web application** that the app depends on. This included front-end and back-end development using PHP, HTML, and CSS.

## 📚 Documentation

The project includes a manual that provides:
- Installation instructions
- Feature overview
- User guide
- Technical documentation (if applicable)

## 🚫 Git Ignore

We've added a `.gitignore` to exclude:
- Build artifacts
- IDE-specific files
- Sensitive information (e.g., signing keys)

## ✅ Status

- [x] Android app built and functional
- [x] Web backend complete
- [x] Database structure in place
- [x] Manual created
